# Overview

**Appsteroids** is a web-based, interactive solar system simulation built with JavaScript and WebGL. This project is an educational tool to demonstrate planetary orbits and the relative positions of celestial bodies in real-time. It uses the power of modern web technologies to deliver a rich, dynamic, and visually appealing 3D experience directly in the browser.

### Key Features:
- **Realistic Simulation**: The orrery accurately calculates and displays the orbits of planets based on their actual orbital parameters, like eccentricity, inclination, and distance from the Sun.
- **WebGL for Graphics**: WebGL is utilized to render 3D graphics directly in the browser, offering smooth, hardware-accelerated animations.
- **Interactive Control**: Users can manipulate the model by zooming, rotating, and changing the viewing angles, providing a hands-on understanding of orbital mechanics.

## Technical Breakdown

### 1. **Physics and Orbital Mechanics**
   - The core of the project is based on Newtonian mechanics and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The planetary bodies follow realistic elliptical orbits around the Sun.
   - The orbits are pre-calculated using numerical methods to solve **Keplerâ€™s Equation**, ensuring accurate representation of each planet's position and velocity at any given time.

### 2. **WebGL for Rendering**
   - **WebGL** is the backbone for rendering the 3D environment. It allows for hardware-accelerated graphics, which ensures the solar system can be visualized fluidly even on complex simulations.
   - **Three.js** (a popular JavaScript library) is used to abstract WebGL's complexities and provide a higher-level interface for handling 3D objects, lights, and materials.

### 3. **Interactive User Experience**
   - **Interactivity** is a crucial aspect of Appsteroids. The user can freely zoom in/out and rotate the camera view to observe planetary orbits from different perspectives.
   - The simulation also provides a **time control** feature, allowing users to fast-forward or rewind the motion of planets, which helps in visualizing the orbital paths over long periods.
  
### 4. **NASA Data**
   - The project uses **NASA's Data** or publicly available ephemeris data to accurately position the planets at any given time. This data ensures that the simulation stays true to the real-world positioning of celestial objects.

### 5. **Optimizations**
   - To ensure smooth performance in real-time, optimizations such as **LOD (Level of Detail)** for distant planets and efficient rendering techniques are employed.
